  <h2>Visualizing.JP</h2>
  <p class="flow-text">Visualizing.JP is a webzine for people who are interested in data visualization and related topics. It’s mainly for Japanese speakers now. On this site, we focus on practical articles and examples because we would like to empower people in Japan who can make data visualization works. As Ben Fry wrote in "Visualizing Data", knowledge of statistics, data mining, graphic design, information visualization, information design, coding, as well as web technology are extensive. Initially we focus on online data visualization but we will also deal with the following neighboring topics. Open data, open government, data journalism, big data and data science.</p>
  <p class="flow-text">We have started the site since June 2013.</p>

  <h2>Data Visualization Japan</h2>
  <p class="flow-text">Data Visualization Japan is a Japan-based (mainly in Tokyo now though) community for people who are interested in data visualization and related topics. It is also available as a Facebook Group, but it’s mainly for Japanese speakers (posts in English are also welcome, though). If you are an English speaker and want to catch up with our latest events, meetups, and workshops, please join us!</p>
  <p class="flow-text">We have started the community since September 2014. There are over 2300 members in Facebook group and 125 members in Meetup.com (as of November 2017).</p>
